This is a SIH finalist project whhich contain codes and files to create an interface of a device which can used by specially-disabled peoples.
In this project we used HTML,CSS and Flask(for backend)
it contains three sections : first one is image to speech converter, second one is text to speech converter, and third one is for people who dont have hands or cannot physically interact with the device(such as hand mouse or eye mouse).
This is based on AAC(Augmentative and Alternative Communication) concept which is a way for people to communicate when they do not have the physical ability to use verbal speech or writing.
It cotians images and text which used on daily purpose by a person , so that it can easily communicate with the family.
This project helps the people with physically challenges to be confident and and also helps them tyo interact with public. 
This AAC device can also be used in medical sector for people who are not able to move for few day by an accident.
It also helps the environment to handle the situations where people want to communicate with family despite the situation where they are not able to speak or move.
